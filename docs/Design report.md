## Design report

On Wednesday the 17th we sat down on the 2nd floor of the Sun and had a meeting about how we would like the project to look in two and a half weeksâ€™ time when we would hand it in.
We decided that we would implement the game using a 2D-array and we wouldn't create a console program first because that would be a waste of time because we agreed that we would like to have it web-based. It would have a black background and the Tic Tac Toe game itself would be white. Under the game there should be a scoreboard of how many points each player has in the current game session. 
We decided not to have fixed meetings but we had "scrum" meeetings every other day and worked on the project together after school.
We had a markdown TODO list in the README file in GitHub. We had further information on the TODO list in a Google Sheets file even though we had the markdown list in Github. We also had a Google Docs file where we would put ideas relative to the project.
We used pair programming quite a lot in the proccess.
We also established some ground rules, e.g. when someone has headphones on they are "in the zone" and should not be interrupted.
