## Development manual
Welcome to the TicTacToe team! We're glad to have you on board.

First things first, make sure you have the following development tools up to date:
## Dev Setup
#### Dev environment
* Git  version >= 2.19.1
* Node version >= 8.12.0
* npm  version >= 6.04.1
* And a text editor of choice


#### For first time setup perform:
```
git clone git@github.com:Brogramminggods/TicTacToe.git

cd TicTacToe

npm install
```
#### When running the web app:
```
npm run build

```
Making changes to the code while running devserver will be immediately visible on the local port. Try it!
